# What's New in ThothBlueprint v0.0.11

This release introduces experimental AI-powered schema assistance and powerful composite primary key support for complex database designs.

## Highlights

- **Composite Primary Key Support:** Define and manage multi-column primary keys directly in the schema editor. Easily toggle multiple columns as part of a composite key without the need for workarounds or comments.
- **AI Schema Assistant (Experimental):** Introducing an AI-powered companion powered by Google Gemini that helps you refactor schemas, implement many-to-many relationships, add nested comment structures, and resolve design issues in real-time.

## New & Improved

- **Composite PK Management:**
  - Click the new **Manage PK** button in any table to open a multi-select dialog and define composite primary keys.
  - Per-column PK toggle no longer enforces single-key constraints—select multiple columns to create composites.
  - Visual badges show `Composite PK (N)` in both the accordion editor and canvas table nodes.
  - Full export support: DBML, SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL), and JSON all correctly reflect composite keys.
  - Composite PKs are automatically recognized on import from SQL dumps and DBML files.

- **Experimental AI Schema Assistant:**
  - Ask the Schema Assistant to help with schema refactoring, design suggestions, and relationship setup.
  - Currently powered by **Google Gemini** API (unlock with your own API key).
  - Future releases will support additional AI providers.
  - Chat history is saved locally per diagram and is not synced to any server.
  - Use with caution: AI suggestions should be reviewed before applying to production schemas.

## Performance & Stability

- Schema assistant runs fully client-side with no persistent server interaction (diagrams remain offline-first).
- Composite PK state persists in IndexedDB alongside existing diagram data—no schema migration required.

## Notes

- The AI Schema Assistant is an **experimental feature**. API usage policies and rate limits apply per your Gemini API plan.
- Ensure your API key has appropriate permissions and is kept secure.
- All AI suggestions should be reviewed for correctness before committing to your schema.

# What’s New in ThothBlueprint v0.0.10

This release focuses on a more compact home page experience, improved checkpoint defaults, and a new DBML editing workflow.

## Highlights

- **Improved Compact Home Page:** Refined the home page layout to feel cleaner, tighter, and more space-efficient.
- **Checkpoint Default Update:** Set automatic checkpoint interval default to **5 minutes** for safer recovery without manual setup.
- **New DBML Editor:** Added a DBML editor tab with write/edit support and sync back to the visual diagram.

## New & Improved

- **Compact Home Page UI:** Reduced visual clutter and improved layout density for faster navigation in the home experience.
- **5-Minute Checkpoint Baseline:** New projects now start with a practical default checkpoint interval to reduce risk of lost changes.
- **DBML Round-Trip Editing:** You can now edit DBML directly and save to synchronize schema/table changes with the diagram canvas.

# What’s New in ThothBlueprint v0.0.9

This release focuses on onboarding experience, in-app guidance, and editor responsiveness improvements for larger diagrams.

## Highlights

- **Guided Onboarding Tour:** Added a reusable product tour for both Gallery and Editor with contextual steps and spotlight guidance.
- **Help Center:** Introduced a dedicated Help Center dialog with quick access to tour, shortcuts, and release notes.
- **Performance Pass:** Improved editor responsiveness by reducing heavy comparisons and tightening update paths in critical interaction flows.
- **Checkpoint System:** Added diagram checkpoints with migration safeguards, manual checkpoint creation, interval-based automatic capture, and restore history.

## New & Improved

- **Context-Aware Guided Experience:** Tour tracking is now stored per context (Gallery vs Editor), so each area can be introduced independently.
- **Tour + What’s New Orchestration:** First-time flow now avoids overlap by sequencing guided experience and release notes more cleanly.
- **Responsive Tour Layout:** Improved positioning and compact behavior for mobile/tablet to keep controls readable on smaller screens.
- **Table Copy UX:** Added copy actions in table menus (including the 3-dot menu) with improved popover behavior after copy.
- **Clipboard Indicator:** Added a visible copied-items indicator in the editor so paste readiness is always clear.
- **Edge Interaction Reliability:** Improved edge selection handling so relationship interactions are more consistent.
- **Checkpoint Migration Flow:** Added a post-update, user-controlled checkpoint migration prompt with backup-first behavior before enabling migration.
- **Manual Checkpoints:** Added one-click manual checkpoint creation with optional labels for easier recovery milestones.
- **Automatic Checkpoints:** Added interval-based automatic checkpoint capture with configurable settings and retention pruning.
- **Checkpoint Browser:** Added checkpoint history browsing with preview details and restore confirmation.
- **Checkpoint Visibility in Sidebar:** Added clickable checkpoint totals in editor metadata to open checkpoint history quickly.

## Performance & Stability

- Removed expensive deep stringification from hot React memo comparison paths in key editor components.
- Optimized paste flow to use an atomic state update and improved node ID generation reliability.
- Fixed store consistency by ensuring diagram map synchronization across diagram mutation actions.
- Reduced callback/dependency churn in editor interaction handlers to avoid avoidable rerenders.
- Added background checkpoint interval ticks while editing to avoid reload-coupled checkpoint creation behavior.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed touch interaction regression where tables, notes, and zones could not be dragged/moved properly on mobile/tablet devices ([Issue #32](https://github.com/AHS12/thoth-blueprint/issues/32)).

## Notes

- This section reflects features delivered so far in `v0.0.9` and may be expanded before final release.

# What’s New in ThothBlueprint v0.0.8

This release focuses on improving relationship lines, offering manual layout adjustments, and fixing issues with duplicate relationships in complex diagrams.

## Highlights

- **Manual Adjustment of Relationship Lines:** You can now manually adjust the path of relationship lines to untangle complex diagrams and improve readability.
- **Duplicate Relationship Prevention:** Added validation to prevent the creation of duplicate relationships between table fields.

## New & Improved

- **Draggable Relationship Handles:** Selected edges now feature draggable handles, allowing for interactive position adjustments.
- **Reset Manual Adjustments:** Added a reset button in the inspector panel to quickly clear any manual position adjustments and revert to auto-routing.
- **Improved Edge Routing:** Edge path calculations now intelligently use your manual center points when available.
- **Duplicate Detection:** The diagram editor now detects both same-direction and reverse-direction duplicate connections by comparing source/target nodes and column handles.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where duplicate relationships between tables could still be created by dragging connection points (Issue #37).

- For MySQL, export schema via `mysqldump --no-data`; for PostgreSQL, use `pg_dump -s`.
- Lock zones before reorganizing to protect critical areas.

Thanks for using ThothBlueprint!
